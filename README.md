Weekly Game Jam 149 Game

Just when you thought you can go finally go home, when you see that there is only one box put on the shelf, that LAST ONE LEFT and you finish the day. That is when you get new orders and realize, there is never LAST ONE LEFT, job is never done. 

Do you have what it takes to survive on this anti-survival horror game? Can you get the true ending?
